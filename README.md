What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 

Some of the features necessary to create a clear and organized application were to create a list goals and objective, define requirements, design and developed code. The screen features where to provide elements with a secure login, notifications were to be display and interact with user based on database to manage and control inventory.

How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 

I try to follow the requirement list and always considered how one application goes  to the other, the elements needed and methods.

Why were your designs successful?

My design was not successful and did struggle. Still, I’m really satisfied because I put a lot of effort and it brought my creative  side bringing a big interesting in bettering myself as a designer and developer.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? 

I approach the process of coding  by understanding how the UI is to interact giving me a visual and therefore made it easier to apply features.

What techniques or strategies did you use? 

One of the strategies when designing and developing is to create small goals, first starting with the design and then continue with the development.

How could those be applied in the future?

It allows me to have a clear and visual flow by creating small goals and make adjustments as I go.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? 

I tested by executing often and ensuring that I corrected any errors. 

Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I had to innovate to overcome a challenge in the design process of the UI. Though, this is the easiest I couldn’t help it but to mess  with it since I enjoyed it too much. Therefore, I had to stop rethink and refocus into my small strategy goals to avoid taking too much time.
